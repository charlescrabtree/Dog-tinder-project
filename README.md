### || What is Barkle? ||

Barkle is a social chat app made for dog owners to meet and connect with others.

### || How does it work? ||

Sign up, or sign in

After signing up, you'll be redirected to 'My Pawfile.' You can add your information there. You'll be able to edit your name, pawfile picture, and bio at anytime.

'Pawfiles' will show all available users on Barkle, and their details if you click on the pawfile user.

'Dog Park' will take you to the chat feature so you can chat with everyone, in a forum style.
